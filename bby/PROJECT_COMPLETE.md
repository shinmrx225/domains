## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Galaxy Behavior
Edit `assets/js/galaxy-clean.js` - `this.config` object:
```javascript
autoZoomTimeout: 1500,    // Auto zoom-out delay (ms)
orbitRadius: {min: 25, max: 45}, // Particle orbit distance
particleCount: 300,       // Background particles
spiralArms: 4,           // Number of spiral arms
galaxyRadius: 100,       // Overall galaxy size
rotationSpeed: 0.3,      // Orbital rotation speed
zoomLevel: 65           // Camera zoom distance
```

### Upload Limits
Edit `api/upload.php`:
```php
$maxFileSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB max file size
$allowedTypes = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif', 'webp']; // Allowed file types
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If galaxy doesn't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Use debug mode: `galaxy.html?debug=true`
3. Verify all files uploaded correctly
4. Check PHP error logs
5. Run the test suite: `galaxy-final-test.html`

### If uploads don't work:
1. Verify `uploads/` folder permissions (755)
2. Check PHP `upload_max_filesize` setting
3. Ensure PHP is enabled on hosting
4. Check browser network tab for failed requests

### If sharing doesn't work:
1. Verify `data/` folder permissions (755)
2. Check if PHP JSON functions are available
3. Test API endpoints directly
