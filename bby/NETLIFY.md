# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide - Galaxy Repository

## ✨ Static Version for Netlify

Since Netlify only supports static files (no PHP backend), I've created a **client-side only version** that works perfectly on Netlify using browser storage!

## 📁 Files to Upload to Netlify

Upload **only these files** to Netlify:

### ✅ **Required Files:**
```
├── index-static.html       # Upload page (rename to index.html)
├── galaxy-static.html      # Galaxy view 
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   ├── upload.css     # Upload page styles
│   │   └── galaxy.css     # Galaxy page styles
│   └── js/
│       ├── upload-static.js    # Static upload functionality
│       └── galaxy-static.js    # Static galaxy visualization
└── _redirects             # Netlify redirect rules (create this)
```

### ❌ **Don't Upload (PHP files won't work on Netlify):**
- `api/` folder
- `upload.php`, `files.php`, `share.php`
- `data/` folder
- Regular `index.html` and `galaxy.html`

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. **Prepare Files**
Rename the static files:
- `index-static.html` → `index.html`
- Keep `galaxy-static.html` as is

### 2. **Create _redirects file**
Create a `_redirects` file in your root directory:
```
/galaxy.html /galaxy-static.html 200
/*           /index.html        200
```

### 3. **Deploy to Netlify**

#### **Option A: Drag & Drop (Easiest)**
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up/login
3. Drag the prepared files to the deploy area
4. Your site will be live immediately!

#### **Option B: Git Integration**
1. Push files to GitHub/GitLab
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Set build directory to `/` (root)
4. Deploy automatically on commits

### 4. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
1. In Netlify dashboard → Domain Settings
2. Add your custom domain
3. Netlify will handle HTTPS automatically

## 💾 How Static Version Works

### **Client-Side Storage:**
- **IndexedDB** for storing uploaded images as base64
- **Local browser storage** for gallery sharing
- **No server required** - everything runs in the browser

### **Image Processing:**
- **FileReader API** reads uploaded files
- **Canvas API** generates thumbnails
- **Base64 encoding** stores images locally

### **Share Functionality:**
- **URL parameters** for sharing galleries
- **Browser storage** for persistence
- **Cross-device compatibility** (if same browser)

## 🌟 Features that Work on Netlify

### ✅ **Fully Working:**

- ✅ Image thumbnail generation  
- ✅ 3D galaxy visualization

### ⚠️ **Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Shared galleries only work on same device/browser
- ⚠️ Images stored in browser (not on server)
- ⚠️ Large galleries may hit browser storage limits

## 🔗 Example Netlify URLs

`https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

**Custom domain:**
`https://yourdomain.com`

**Share links will look like:**
