# Galaxy Repository - Issue Fixed! ðŸŒŒ

## What Was Wrong

The issue you experienced was caused by **browser caching** and **corrupted upload data**:

1. **Files weren't actually uploaded**: The upload process recorded file metadata in the database but failed to save the actual image files to the server
2. **Browser cache**: Your browser was loading old, corrupted data instead of making fresh API calls
3. **Missing files**: All 112 "uploaded" images returned 404 errors because they didn't actually exist on the server

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Cleared Corrupted Data**
- Removed all phantom file records from the database
- Cleared any cached browser data
- Reset the system to a clean state

### 2. **Fixed Upload Path Issues**
- Updated `upload.php` to use absolute file paths for server operations
- Fixed file path references to use web-relative URLs for browser access
- Ensured proper directory creation and permissions

### 3. **Added Cache Prevention**
- Added cache-busting parameters to API calls
- Added no-cache headers to prevent browser caching issues
- Clear localStorage/sessionStorage on galaxy initialization

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Better error logging in the upload process
- Improved fallback handling for missing images
- Added debugging tools for troubleshooting
