# 🌟 InfinityFree Hosting - Share Gallery Compatibility Guide

## ✅ **Share Galaxy Features on InfinityFree**

**GOOD NEWS**: Your share galaxy system **WILL WORK** on InfinityFree with minor adjustments!

### **What Works:**
- ✅ **Creating shareable galaxy links**
- ✅ **Storing shared gallery data**
- ✅ **Viewing shared galaxies**
- ✅ **JSON file storage**
- ✅ **PHP backend API**

### **Potential Issues & Solutions:**

#### **1. Directory Permissions**
**Problem**: InfinityFree may not auto-create the `data/` directory.

**Solution**: 
1. **Manually create `data/` folder** via File Manager
2. **Set permissions to 755**
3. **Create empty `shared_galleries.json`** file

#### **2. File Write Access**
**Problem**: Some free hosts restrict file writing.

**Solution**: We'll create a backup system using both file storage and URL parameters.

#### **3. Storage Persistence**
**Problem**: Free hosts may clean up files.

**Solution**: Shared galleries are lightweight (just JSON metadata), so storage impact is minimal.

### **URL-Based Sharing** (No file storage needed)
1. **Gallery data encoded in URL parameters**
2. **No server storage required**
3. **Works on ANY hosting provider**
4. **Unlimited sharing capability**
