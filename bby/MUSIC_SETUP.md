# 🎵 How to Add Background Music to Your Galaxy

## Quick Setup (3 Easy Steps):

### 1. **Get Your Music File Ready**
- Any romantic/ambient music you want
- Should be in MP3 format (best compatibility)
- Keep it under 10MB for faster loading
- 2-5 minutes long (it will loop automatically)

### 2. **Add the Music File**
- Copy your music file to: `assets/audio/`
- **Name it exactly**: `galaxy-music.mp3`
- That's it! The galaxy will automatically find and play it

### 3. **Test It**
- Open your galaxy: `galaxy.html`
- Music should start playing automatically
- If it doesn't auto-play (browser security), it will start on first click/touch

## 🎼 Music Behavior:

- **Auto-plays** when galaxy loads (or on first user interaction)
- **Loops continuously** for romantic atmosphere
- **Volume set to 30%** (not too loud, just ambient)
- **No controls** - just pure background ambiance
- **Graceful fallback** - galaxy works perfectly without music too

## 📁 File Structure:
```
assets/
  audio/
    galaxy-music.mp3  ← Put your music file here
```

## 🎨 Music Recommendations:

Perfect for your romantic galaxy:
- Ambient space music
- Soft piano melodies  
- Romantic instrumentals
- Lo-fi ambient tracks
- Gentle orchestral pieces

## 🔧 Technical Notes:

- **Format**: MP3 is recommended (best browser support)
- **Fallback**: WAV and OGG also supported (change filename in code)
- **Size**: Keep under 10MB for good loading performance
- **Quality**: 128kbps is fine for background music
- **Auto-play**: Modern browsers may require user interaction first

## 💝 Result:

Your galaxy will have beautiful background music that plays softly while your loved one explores your cosmic memories! ✨🌌💕
